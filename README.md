# SecDB

Encrypted Key-Value Store with locally managed keys.


## Features

- Encrypted key-value store
- Range queries
- Prefix queries


## Why

I have several projects that need a general purpose, local, encrypted key-value database.  
Something that could possibly get synchronized with a cloud-based storage.

This database will be used in the following projects:

- [Access Panel](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/AccessPanelPublic)
- Secure Digital Archive
- Secure, simple, elderly-oriented email client
