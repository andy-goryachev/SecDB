# SecDB

Encrypted Key-Value Store.



## Features

- Encrypted key-value store
- Bi-directional range queries
- Bi-directional prefix queries
- Append-only files for ease of synchronization


## How to Use

*The library is not yet reado for production use*.



## Why

I have several projects that need a general purpose, local, encrypted key-value database.  
Something that could possibly get synchronized with a cloud-based storage.

This database will be used in the following projects:

- [Access Panel](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/AccessPanelPublic)
- Encrypted Notes
- Secure Digital Archive
- Secure, simple, elderly-oriented email client
