# SecDB

Secure Local Key-Value Store with locally managed keys.


## Features

- Simple embeddable key-value store with range queries
- Encrypted at rest


## Why

I have several projects that need a general purpose, local, encrypted key-value database.  
Something that could possibly get syncronized with a cloud-based storage.

This database will be used in the following projects:

- [Access Panel](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/AccessPanelPublic)
- Secure Digital Archive
- Security and Elderly-oriented email client
